                <p class="jp-text">Jurassic Park is a 1993 American science fiction adventure film directed by
                    Steven Spielberg and produced by Kathleen Kennedy and Gerald R. Molen. It is the first installment
                    in the Jurassic Park franchise, and is based on the 1990 novel of the same name by Michael Crichton
                    and a screenplay written by Crichton and David Koepp. The film is set on the fictional island of
                    Isla Nublar, located off Central America's Pacific Coast near Costa Rica. There, wealthy businessman
                    John Hammond and a team of genetic scientists have created a wildlife park of de-extinct dinosaurs.
                    When industrial sabotage leads to a catastrophic shutdown of the park's power facilities and
                    security precautions, a small group of visitors and Hammond's grandchildren struggle to survive and
                    escape the perilous island.</p>

                    post-production rolled until May 1993, supervised by Spielberg in Poland as he filmed Schindler's
                    List. The dinosaurs were created with groundbreaking computer-generated imagery by Industrial Light
                    & Magic (ILM) and with life-sized animatronic dinosaurs built by Stan Winston's team. To showcase
                    the film's sound design, which included a mixture of various animal noises for the dinosaur roars,
                    Spielberg invested in the creation of DTS, a company specializing in digital surround sound formats.
                    The film also underwent an extensive $65 million marketing campaign, which included licensing deals
                    with over 100 companies.</p>

                <p class="jp-text">Jurassic Park premiered on June 9, 1993, at the Uptown Theater in Washington, D.C.,
                    and was released on June 11 in the United States. It went on to gross over $912 million worldwide in
                    its original theatrical run, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1993 and the highest-grossing
                    film ever at the time, a record held until the release of Titanic in 1997. It received highly
                    positive reviews from critics, who praised its special effects, acting, John Williams' musical
                    score, and Spielberg's direction. Following its 3D re-release in 2013 to celebrate its 20th
                    anniversary, Jurassic Park became the seventeenth film in history to surpass $1 billion in ticket
                    sales. The film won more than twenty awards, including three Academy Awards for its technical
                    achievements in visual effects and sound design. Jurassic Park is considered a landmark in the
                    development of computer-generated imagery and animatronic visual effects. The film was followed by
                    four commercially successful sequels: The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997), Jurassic Park III
                    (2001), Jurassic World (2015), and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018), with a fifth sequel,
                    Jurassic World: Dominion, scheduled for a 2022 release.</p>
